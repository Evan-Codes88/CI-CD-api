# Automation Workflow: Purpose & Functionalities for RentSync

## What Is an Automation Workflow?

An automation workflow is a structured, programmable sequence of tasks, decisions, and integrations that automates repetitive or complex processes with minimal human intervention. It acts as a digital orchestrator, triggered by specific events or conditions, executing predefined steps to achieve consistent, efficient, and scalable outcomes. In the context of RentSync, a rental inspection and data synchronisation application, automation workflows drive the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, ensuring code is tested, logged, and deployed reliably.

## Purpose of Automation Workflows

Automation workflows serve multiple critical objectives in RentSync’s CI/CD pipeline:

- **Time Savings**: Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., running tests, deploying code) to reduce manual effort, allowing developers to focus on coding.
- **Accuracy and Consistency**: Standardise processes (e.g., test execution, log generation) to eliminate human errors, ensuring consistent results.
- **Efficiency and Productivity**: Accelerate development cycles by automating testing, artifact generation, and deployments, enabling faster feature delivery.
- **Compliance and Auditability**: Log every step (e.g., test results, deployment status) for traceability, critical for regulatory or quality assurance needs.
- **Scalability**: Handle increased workloads (e.g., more commits or deployments) without proportional resource increases.
- **Complex Orchestration**: Integrate multiple systems (e.g., GitHub, AWS, MongoDB) to streamline workflows across tools.

## Key Functionalities of an Automation Workflow

Automation workflows in RentSync’s CI/CD pipeline include:

- **Triggering Mechanism**: Events like code pushes, pull requests, or schedules (e.g., daily at midnight AEST) initiate workflows.
- **Conditional Logic**: Decision points, such as skipping deployments if no new commits exist, guide the workflow path.
- **Actions**: Tasks like running Jest tests, uploading logs to S3, or deploying to Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Loops/Iterations**: Retry logic for failed tests or deployments (e.g., retrying up to 2 times).
- **Data Handling**: Transform and store data, such as parsing test results into JSON or uploading artifacts.
- **Error Handling**: Manage failures with retries, fallbacks, and notifications to ensure robustness.
- **Notifications**: Alert teams via Slack or email on success, failure, or skipped deployments.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Generate and store logs (e.g., `test-results-<commit-sha>.log`) for debugging and compliance.

### Error Handling

Error handling ensures robust workflows in RentSync’s CI/CD pipeline. Key strategies include:

- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed actions (e.g., Jest tests or Elastic Beanstalk deployments) up to 2 times with a 5-second delay to handle transient issues like network failures.
- **Fallback Actions**: Use alternative paths if primary actions fail (e.g., log errors locally if S3 upload fails).
- **Error Notifications**: Send alerts via Slack for test or deployment failures, including error details for quick debugging.
- **Logging Errors**: Record detailed failure information (e.g., error codes, timestamps) in S3 and GitHub Actions logs for auditability.
- **Graceful Continuation**: Use `|| echo` clauses and `if: always()` to ensure subsequent steps run even after failures, maintaining workflow integrity.

In RentSync, error handling is implemented in `ci.yml` (e.g., test retries, S3 upload fallbacks) and `deploy.yml` (e.g., deployment retries, commit comparison to skip redundant runs).

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: RentSync Test Automation

- **Trigger**: Developer pushes code to `main`.
- **Steps**: Checkout code, set up Node.js 18, install dependencies, run Jest tests with 2 retries, generate `test-results.json` and `test-results-custom.log`, upload to `s3://${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET_NAME }}/test-logs/`, archive artifacts.
- **Outcome**: Ensures code quality, stores logs persistently, notifies team of failures via Slack.

### Example 2: RentSync Scheduled Deployment

- **Trigger**: Daily at midnight AEST (`0 14 * * *` UTC).
- **Steps**: Check for new commits using GitHub API and S3-stored `last-deployed-commit.txt`. If new commits, run `ci.yml` tests, package `application.zip`, deploy to Elastic Beanstalk, update `last-deployed-commit.txt`.
- **Outcome**: Prevents redundant deployments, ensures only new code is deployed, maintains auditability.

### Example 3: Error Handling with Fallback

- **Trigger**: Pull request to `main` with failing tests.
- **Steps**: Run Jest tests, fail after 2 retries, generate error log in `test-results-custom.log`, attempt S3 upload, fallback to local storage if upload fails, notify team via Slack.
- **Outcome**: Ensures failures are logged and communicated, maintaining workflow robustness.

## Workflow Tools & Platforms

- **GitHub Actions**: Used for RentSync’s CI/CD, with YAML workflows and cloud-hosted runners. Ideal for cloud integration and ease of use.
- **Zapier/Make**: Simplifies app integrations (e.g., Slack to CRMs), but less suited for complex CI/CD.
- **Jenkins**: Supports complex, self-hosted pipelines, but requires significant setup.
- **Apache Airflow**: Best for data pipeline automation, not CI/CD.
- **UiPath**: Suited for GUI-based robotic process automation, not code-centric workflows.

RentSync uses GitHub Actions for its seamless GitHub integration, extensive marketplace, and cloud-native simplicity.

## How to Design an Automation Workflow

1. **Define Goals**: Ensure code quality and rapid deployment for RentSync.
2. **Identify Triggers**: `push`, `pull_request`, or scheduled runs at midnight AEST.
3. **Map Steps**: Test, log, package, deploy, notify.
4. **Add Conditions**: Skip deployments if no new commits.
5. **Handle Data**: Store test results, deployment artifacts, and logs.
6. **Include Error Handling**: Retry tests/deployments, fallback to local storage, notify team.
7. **Test and Optimise**: Run workflows with test commits, refine retry logic or notifications.

## RentSync CI/CD Workflows

### `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration

- **Purpose**: Automates testing, log generation, and artifact storage.
- **Triggers**: `push` to `main`, `pull_request` to `main`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Checkout code (`actions/checkout@v4`).
  2. Set up Node.js 18 (`actions/setup-node@v4`).
  3. Install dependencies (`npm install`).
  4. Debug Jest setup (`npx jest --version`).
  5. Run tests (`npx jest --ci --json`) with 2 retries.
  6. Generate `test-results.json`, `test-results-custom.log`, `test-summary.json`.
  7. Debug AWS setup (`aws s3 ls`).
  8. Upload logs to `s3://${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET_NAME }}/test-logs/`.
  9. Upload logs to `s3://${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET_NAME }}/DEV-API/DEVAPI-env/logs/`.
  10. Archive artifacts.
- **Conditional Logic**: Tests fail: Retry twice, log error, notify via Slack. S3 upload fails: Fallback to local artifacts, notify team.
- **Error Handling**: `|| echo` clauses, `if: always()` for log uploads and archiving.
- **Outputs**: Artifacts (`test-results.json`, `test-results-custom.log`, `test-summary.json`), S3 logs (`test-results-<commit-sha>.log`).

### `deploy.yml` - Deployment

- **Purpose**: Deploys to Elastic Beanstalk, checks for new commits on schedule.
- **Triggers**: `push` to `main`, `schedule` at midnight AEST (`0 14 * * *`).
- **Steps**:
  1. Run `ci.yml` tests (`needs: test`).
  2. Check for new commits (GitHub API, S3 `last-deployed-commit.txt`).
  3. Checkout code, set up Node.js, install dependencies.
  4. Create `application.zip`.
  5. Debug AWS setup (`aws s3 ls`, `aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environments`).
  6. Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk via S3.
  7. Save last deployed commit SHA to S3.
- **Conditional Logic**: Tests pass: Proceed to deployment. Schedule trigger: Deploy only if new commits. Deployment fails: Retry twice, notify team.
- **Error Handling**: `|| echo` clauses, `if: always()` for commit SHA saving.
- **Outputs**: Deployed application in `devapi-env`, S3 (`application-<commit-sha>.zip`, `last-deployed-commit.txt`).

## Additional Examples

- **Successful CI/CD Run**: Push to `main` runs `ci.yml` (tests pass, logs uploaded to S3, artifacts archived) and `deploy.yml` (deploys `application.zip` to `devapi-env`, updates `last-deployed-commit.txt`, notifies team via Slack).
- **Skipped Scheduled Deployment**: Midnight AEST schedule finds no new commits (`has-changes=false`), skips deployment, notifies team via Slack.
- **Test Failure with Fallback**: Pull request with failing tests retries twice, logs to `test-results-custom.log`, falls back to local artifact storage if S3 upload fails, notifies team via Slack.

## Debugging

- **No Workflow Runs**: Check `Actions` tab, verify commits to `main`, ensure Actions enabled in `Settings`.
- **S3/Elastic Beanstalk Failures**: Review `Debug AWS setup` logs, confirm `S3_BUCKET_NAME` and AWS credentials, test permissions (`aws s3 ls`).
- **Test Failures**: Check `Debug Jest setup` logs, ensure `"test": "jest"` in `package.json`.
- **JWT Errors**: Verify `JWT_SECRET` in secrets and `index.js` middleware.
- **MongoDB**: Confirm `MONGODB_URI` in secrets and Elastic Beanstalk environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Secrets**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `S3_BUCKET_NAME` in `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`.
- **AWS Resources**: S3 bucket (`${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET_NAME }}`) with `test-logs/` and `DEV-API/DEVAPI-env/logs/`. Elastic Beanstalk application `DEV API`, environment `devapi-env` in `ap-southeast-2`.
- **Node.js Project**: `package.json` with Jest (`npm install --save-dev jest`, `"test": "jest"`), Node.js 18.
- **.ebextensions**: Add `logs.config` to project root for Elastic Beanstalk logs.

## Notes

- **Runner**: `ubuntu-latest` (2.324.0).
- **Artifacts**: 90-day retention in GitHub Actions.
- **Persistent Logs**: Stored in S3 and Elastic Beanstalk.
- **AEST Schedule**: `deploy.yml` runs at midnight AEST (`0 14 * * *` UTC), with commit comparison to avoid redundant deployments.
