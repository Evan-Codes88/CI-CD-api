# Automation Workflow: Purpose & Functionalities for RentSync

## What Is an Automation Workflow?

An automation workflow is a structured, programmable sequence of tasks, decisions, and integrations that automates repetitive or complex processes with minimal human intervention. It acts as a digital orchestrator, triggered by specific events or conditions, executing predefined steps to achieve consistent, efficient, and scalable outcomes. In the context of RentSync, a rental inspection and data synchronization application, automation workflows drive the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, ensuring code is tested, logged, and deployed reliably.

## Purpose of Automation Workflows

Automation workflows serve multiple critical objectives, particularly in a CI/CD context like RentSync’s:

- **Time Savings**: Automate repetitive tasks (e.g. running tests, deploying code) to reduce manual effort, allowing developers to focus on coding.
- **Accuracy and Consistency**: Standardise processes (e.g. test execution, log generation) to eliminate human errors, ensuring consistent results.
- **Efficiency and Productivity**: Speed up development cycles by automating testing, artifact generation, and deployments, enabling faster feature delivery.
- **Compliance and Auditability**: Log every step (e.g. test results, deployment status) for traceability, critical for regulatory or quality assurance needs.
- **Scalability**: Handle increased workloads (e.g. more commits or deployments) without proportional resource increases.
- **Complex Orchestration**: Integrate multiple systems (e.g. GitHub, AWS, MongoDB) to streamline workflows across tools.

## Key Functionalities of an Automation Workflow

Automation workflows in RentSync’s CI/CD pipeline include:

- **Triggering Mechanism**: Events like code pushes, pull requests, or schedules (e.g. daily at midnight AEST) initiate workflows.
- **Conditional Logic**: Decision points, such as skipping deployments if no new commits exist, guide the workflow path.
- **Actions**: Tasks like running Jest tests, uploading logs to S3, or deploying to Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Loops/Iterations**: Retry logic for failed tests or deployments (e.g. retrying up to 2 times).
- **Data Handling**: Transform and store data, such as parsing test results into JSON or uploading artifacts.
- **Error Handling**: Manage failures with retries, fallbacks, and notifications to ensure robustness.
- **Notifications**: Alert teams via Slack or email on success, failure, or skipped deployments.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Generate and store logs (e.g. `test-results-<commit-sha>.log`) for debugging and compliance.

### Error Handling

Error handling is critical for robust workflows, especially in RentSync’s CI/CD pipeline. Key strategies include:

- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed actions (e.g. Jest tests or Elastic Beanstalk deployments) up to 2 times with a 5-second delay to handle transient issues like network failures.
- **Fallback Actions**: Use alternative paths if primary actions fail (e.g. log errors locally if S3 upload fails).
- **Error Notifications**: Send alerts via Slack for test or deployment failures, including error details for quick debugging.
- **Logging Errors**: Record detailed failure information (e.g. error codes, timestamps) in S3 and GitHub Actions logs for auditability.
- **Graceful Continuation**: Use `|| echo` clauses and `if: always()` to ensure subsequent steps run even after failures, maintaining workflow integrity.

In RentSync, error handling is implemented in both `ci.yml` (e.g. test retries, S3 upload fallbacks) and `deploy.yml` (e.g. deployment retries, commit comparison to skip redundant runs).
